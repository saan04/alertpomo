# alertpomo

We have used django to integrate the python algorithm for drowsiness detection along with the pomodoro timer
the drowsiness detection algorithm identifies the eye coordinates and creates a face mesh to keep track of sleep
if the eyes are closed for a certain duration of time an alert is popped up

the python file with just the drowsiness detection is available separately for view
and the django integrated portion can be viewed in the srmapp folder

use the pomodoro.html file to access the website
